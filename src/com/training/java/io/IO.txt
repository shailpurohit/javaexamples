Java IO Purposes and Features
Java IO contains many subclasses of the InputStream, OutputStream, Reader and Writer classes. The reason is, that all of these subclasses are addressing various different purposes. That is why there are so many different classes. The purposes addressed are summarized below:

File Access
Network Access
Internal Memory Buffer Access
Inter-Thread Communication (Pipes)
Buffering
Filtering
Parsing
Reading and Writing Text (Readers / Writers)
Reading and Writing Primitive Data (long, int etc.)
Reading and Writing Objects


Some important Byte stream classes.
 
 Stream class								Description
BufferedOutputStream				Used for Buffered Output Stream.
DataInputStream						Contains method for reading java standard datatype
DataOutputStream					An output stream that contain method for writing java standard data type
FileInputStream						Input stream that reads from a file
FileOutputStream					Output stream that write to a file.
InputStream							Abstract class that describe stream input.
OutputStream						Abstract class that describe stream output.
PrintStream							Output Stream that contain print() and println() method

Some important Character stream classes.
 
 Stream class								Description
BufferedReader						Handles buffered input stream.
BufferedWriter						Handles buffered output stream.
FileReader							Input stream that reads from file.
FileWriter							Output stream that writes to file.
InputStreamReader					Input stream that translate byte to character
OutputStreamReader					Output stream that translate character to byte.
PrintWriter							Output Stream that contain print() and println() method.
Reader								Abstract class that define character stream input
Writer								Abstract class that define character stream output
