/**
 * An interface is 100% abstract class(Implicitly). After Java 8 it doesnâ€™t hold true.
 * Interfaces can be implemented by any class from any inheritance tree.
 * All methods in Interfaces are abstract. (In Java 8 either abstract/ static / default)
 * An interface can have constants, these constants are public, static and final(Implicitly).
 * Interface methods are implicitly public & abstract. (Before Java 8)
 * Interface methods can have a body if static or default modifier is used against the method.(Java 8)
 * A class implementing an interface can also be an abstract class.
 * An abstract class which is implementing an interface need not implement all abstract method.
 * A class can Implement more than one Interface.
 * Interfaces can not extend a class or implement an Interface.
 * An interface can extend another Interface.
 * A non-abstract class which is implementing an Interface needs to follow some rules.
 * This class needs to provide the concrete implementation of all abstract method.
 * All rules of Overriding needs to be followed.
 * It must maintain the exact signature of a method.
